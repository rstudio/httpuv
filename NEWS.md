httpuv 1.4.3.9002
=================

* Fixed [#144](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/issues/144): Before closing a handle, make sure that it is not already closing. ([#145](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/pull/145))

* Exported `ipFamily()` function, which tests whether a string represents an IPv4 address, IPv6 address, or neither. ([#142](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/pull/142))

* Templated C++ code with the format `A<B<C>>` has been changed to `A<B<C> >`. Allowing consecutive `>>` is a feature of C++11.

* httpuv is now compiled with `_GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS`, to help catch bugs. ([#137](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/pull/137))

* The Rook `req` environment now includes an item `req$HEADERS`, which is a named character vector of request headers. ([#143](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/pull/143))

* Fixed [#101](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/issues/101): If server creation fails, report reason why. ([#146](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/pull/146), [#149](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/pull/149))

* Fixed [#147](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/issues/147): Santizer complained when starting app with `startPipeServer` after a failed app start. ([#149](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/pull/149))

* Fixed [#150](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/issues/150), [#151](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/issues/151): On some platforms, httpuv would fail to install from a zip file because R's `unzip()` function did not preserve the executable permission for `src/libuv/configure`. ([#152](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/pull/152))

* Worked around an issue where Shiny apps couldn't be viewed when launched from RStudio Server using Firefox. ([#153](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/pull/153))

httpuv 1.4.3
============

* Fixed [#127](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/issues/127): Compilation failed on some platforms because `NULL` was used instead of an `Rcpp::List`. ([#131](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/pull/131))

* Fixed [#133](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/issues/133): Assertion failures when running on Fedora 28. ([#136](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/pull/136))

* Fixed [#134](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/issues/134): Sanitizer complains when starting app after a failed app start. ([#138](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/pull/138))

httpuv 1.4.2
============

* Fixed [#126](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/issues/126): The Makevars.win file had a line with spaces instead of a tab. This caused problems when installing with the `--clean` flag.

* Fixed [#128](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/issues/128): It was possible in rare cases for a segfault to occur when httpuv tried to close a connection twice. ([#129](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/pull/129))

httpuv 1.4.1
============

* Addressed [#123](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/issues/123): `service()` now returns `TRUE`.

* Fixed [#124](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/issues/124): On some CRAN build machines, the build was failing because of issues with the timestamps of input and output files for autotools in libuv/.

httpuv 1.4.0
============

* Changed license from GPL 3 to GPL >= 2. ([#109](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/pull/109))

* Added IPv6 support. ([#115](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/pull/115))

* httpuv now does I/O on a background thread, which should allow for much better performance under load. ([#106](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/pull/106))

* httpuv can now handle request callbacks asynchronously. ([#80](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/pull/80), ([#97](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/pull/97)))

* Fixed [#72](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/issues/72): httpuv previously did not close connections that had the `Connection: close` header, or were HTTP 1.0 (without `Connection: keep-alive`). ([#99](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/pull/99))

* Fixed [#71](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/issues/71): In some cases, compiling httpuv would use system copies of library headers, but use local copies of libraries for linking. ([#121](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/pull/121))

* Let Rcpp handle symbol registration. ([#85](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/pull/85))

* Hide internal symbols from shared library on supported platforms. This reduces the risk of conflicts with other packages bundling libuv. ([#85](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/pull/85))

* Fixed [#86](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/issues/86): `encodeURI()` gave incorrect output for non-ASCII characters. ([#87](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/pull/87))

* Fixed [#49](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/issues/49): Some information was shared across separate requests.

* Upgraded to libuv 1.15.0. ([#91](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/pull/91))

* Upgraded to http-parser 2.7.1. ([#93](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/pull/93))

httpuv 1.3.5
============

* Added function `getRNGState`.


httpuv 1.3.3
============

* Error messages are now sent as UTF-8.

* httpuv no longer adds a Content-Length header if one has already been provided. This is for Shiny issue #876.


httpuv 1.3.2
============

* Add `encodeURI`, `encodeURIComponent`, `decodeURI`, and `decodeURIComponent` functions.

* Compatibility with Rook middleware reference classes.


httpuv 1.3.1
============

* Fix bug where websocket headers split over multiple packets would cause the payload to be parsed incorrectly.


httpuv 1.3.0
============

* Add experimental support for running httpuv servers in the background (see `?startDaemonizedServer` and `?stopDaemonizedServer`). Many thanks to HÃ©ctor Corrada Bravo for the contribution!


httpuv 1.2.3
============

* Require Rcpp 0.11.0. The absence of this requirement made it too easy for Windows and Mac users with Rcpp 0.10 already installed to grab httpuv 1.2.2 binaries from CRAN, which are built against Rcpp 0.11, causing bad crashes due to Rcpp's linkage changes.


httpuv 1.2.2
============

* Export base64 encoding function `rawToBase64`.

* Compatibility work for Rcpp 0.11.0.


httpuv 1.2.1
============

* Solaris 10 compatibility fixes (courtesy of Dr. Brian Ripley).


httpuv 1.2.0
============


* Fix IE10 websocket handshake failure.

* Implement hixie-76 version of WebSocket protocol, for Safari 4 and QtWebKit.


httpuv 1.1.0
============


* Fix issue #8: Bug in concurrent uploads.

* Add `interrupt()` function for stopping the runloop.

* Add REMOTE_ADDR and REMOTE_PORT to request environment.

* Switch from git submodules to git subtree; much easier installation of development builds.

* Upgrade to libuv v0.10.13.

* Fix issue #13: Segfault on successful retry of server creation.


httpuv 1.0.6.3
==============

* Greatly improved stability under heavy load by ignoring SIGPIPE.


httpuv 1.0.6.2
==============

* Work properly with `body=c(file="foo")`. Previously this only worked if body was a list, not a character vector.

* R CMD INSTALL will do `git submodule update --init` if necessary.

* When `onHeaders()` callback returned a body, httpuv was not properly short-circuiting the request.

* Ignore SIGPIPE permanently. This was still causing crashes under heavy real-world traffic.


httpuv 1.0.6.1
==============

* Make request available on websocket object.


httpuv 1.0.6
============

* Support listening on pipes (Unix domain sockets have been tested, Windows named pipes have not been tested but may work).

* Fix crash on CentOS 6.4 due to weird interaction with OpenSSL.


httpuv 1.0.5
============

* Initial release.
