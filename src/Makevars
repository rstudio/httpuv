# Run ./configure to create the Makefile.
#
# On systems that do _not_ have automake installed, we need to make sure that
# configure does not try to run automake, because it will fail. To do that, we
# we need to touch various autotools-related files so it doesn't try to run
# autotools programs again. We also need to make sure configure is executable,
# because on some platforms, calling unzip() in R does not preserve the
# executable bit.
#
# If the system does have automake, then we'll run autogen.sh before configure,
# as per the official build instructions for libuv. autogen.sh will in turn run
# aclocal, autoconf, and automake.
#
# It's VERY IMPORTANT that mtime(aclocal.m4) <= mtime(configure), and also
# mtime(aclocal.m4) <= mtime(Makefile.in). On some platforms, passing multiple
# files to a single touch command gives them all the same time, but on others
# (Solaris and possibly some Fedoras) the timestamps are slightly increasing
# from one to the next, i.e. the order matters. To remove this fragility, we
# use "-r aclocal.m4" to ensure that all three files are guaranteed to have
# precisely the same timestamp value.
